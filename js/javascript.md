# JavaScript

## script in an html

- write `<script></script>` in body and `<script src="script.js" defer></script>` in the head (defer executes it after page load)

## console tricks

- use `\t` for a tab
- use `\n` for a new line
- use `console.clear();` to clear console
- view console in browser or in terminal/VS Code with writing node nameOfJS-file or VSCode: RUN-StartDebugging
- to view the value of a variable, always write `console.log("variableName: ", variableName);` to know which variable is shown

## data types

- these exist: number, string, boolean, BigInt, undefined, null, symbol
- BigInt is used to store large numbers by writing a number followed by _n_, like let `myBigInt = 38952309529385902835n`
- undefined means variable has not been assigned yet
- null means it has been given _null_ value

## mathematical operations

- +, -, \*, /, ++, --, -=, +=, ... work
- ** does _power to_, like 2**3=8
- % is remainder, like 5%2=1
